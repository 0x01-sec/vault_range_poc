# Vault Range PoC
Project Vault Range PoC: Know your enemy and yourself to build better defense-in-depth solution! HardenedVault will share some of technical experience we gained during the daily work of building open source based security solution for platform/infrastructure, e.g: Linux kernel, firmware and cryptography engineering. 

Any contributors are welcomed as well!


## Proof of Concepts

Proof-of-concept/exploit code will be used to demonstrate the security vulnerabilities. Do not tweak them in the production.
